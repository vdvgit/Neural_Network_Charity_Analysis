# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Frustratingly.. been trying to troubleshoot my kernel dying when importing TensorFlow (when I comment out that line, it works fine). I have spent hours googling and trying to get this to work. Will seek help this week from the teaching staff (was not able to join office hours on Saturday).
